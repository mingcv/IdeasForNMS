Hello! As a passionate fan of No Man's Sky, I've been thoroughly enjoying the new Voyagers update, especially the corvette customization. This has sparked some ideas I'd love to share with the development team. I hope you'll consider them!

**A Dual-Layered Architecture for Customization**

Have you considered a dual-layered system for customizable objects? This would consist of:

* **A "Private" Local Layer:** This would allow for a much higher module count, enabling players to create incredibly detailed and intricate designs for their own viewing or for sharing within a private group.
* **A "Public" Online Layer:** This would have a limited module count to ensure smooth performance and reduce data transmission bottlenecks for all players in a shared online space.

**How it could work:**

Players could be notified when they exceed a certain module limit (e.g., 100 modules). Any additional modules would only be visible locally or to their group. Alternatively, players could manually toggle the visibility of each module, deciding which ones contribute to their "online" appearance (up to the limit) and which remain for their detailed "private" view.

This system would significantly enhance the depth of corvette customization and could be expanded to other areas of the game.

**Expanding on Customization Possibilities**

This dual-layered system could pave the way for even more exciting features:

1. **More Flexible Decorative Modules:** Allow for more precise and varied angles when placing decorative items.
2. **Functional Mechanical Parts:** Introducing basic moving parts like telescopic extensions and rotating joints could lead to player-created transforming ships!
3. **Dynamic Ship Systems Control:** Imagine manually controlling the opening and closing of landing bay doors and internal stairways. Players could also manage which engines are active during atmospheric flight, in space, during acceleration, or while warping. These controls could be integrated into the cockpit HUD with hotkey support.
4. **Expanded Weapon Systems:** Consider increasing the limit for each weapon type or the total number of weapons. New weapon types like large-caliber laser cannons and external, launchable missile pods would also be amazing additions.

**Player-Created Worlds**

Building on this dual-layered architecture, you could introduce a groundbreaking planetary creation system:

Once players have explored a significant number of planets and completed the main Atlas storyline, they could be given the ability to create their own star systems. They could choose the star's size and color and then generate planets, defining their basic appearance and fine-tuning different biomes like oceans, tundras, plains, and mountains.

The online, public version of these planets would have a limit on the number of distinct land plots, while the private, local version (shared with a group) could be far more detailed. Players could meticulously sculpt landscapes, create unique lifeforms by combining scanned components (stems, leaves, fruits for plants; heads, limbs, torsos for animals), and place mineral deposits and ruins.

**Community-Driven Content and Recognition**

Other players visiting these custom planets could "like" them. The highest-rated planets could then be officially reviewed and authorized by the development team. Once approved, the more detailed "private" version could be made publicly accessible to all players, and official missions and story points could even be integrated into them.

This would create a continuous stream of high-quality, handcrafted worlds for everyone to explore, fostering a vibrant and creative community. You could even host "Planet Creation Cups" and feature Atlas-certified worlds in community spotlights with accompanying lore.

**A New Frontier: The Genesis Galaxy**

This could all culminate in the creation of a new, player-built "Genesis Galaxy." This galaxy would contain no procedurally generated planetsâ€”every star system would be crafted by players. Loading these detailed worlds could be handled during warp sequences and atmospheric entry.

For balance, you could also introduce a "Warzone Galaxy," a procedurally generated galaxy where players can engage in large-scale celestial combat with superweapons, though this would likely be a significant technical undertaking.

**Enhancing Immersion**

Finally, this dual-layered system could also be applied to player avatars. A high-detail "private" model for the player's own view and a lower-detail "public" model for online interactions would improve performance. This, combined with a more advanced character creation system and a wider range of animations, would greatly enhance player immersion.

Thank you for your time and for creating such an incredible universe for us to explore. The possibilities for the future of No Man's Sky are truly exciting!
